7) Next improvements I can do immediately
	•	Make backend return user_rating in the /api/stores response for authenticated requests (so the list shows “Your rating”) — I can change backend controller for that.
	•	Add server-side pagination + DataTable for admin.
	•	Add optimistic UI (show rating instantly while background save runs).
	•	Replace star UI with a polished component (Heroicons / lucide / shadcn).
	•	Add toasts for success/error.
